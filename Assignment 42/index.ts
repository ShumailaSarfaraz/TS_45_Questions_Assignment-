// Assignment no 42
// Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.

// Create an array of magician's names
let magicians1: string[] =['Akbar ali', 'Haris', 'Zahid'];

function show_magicians(magicians1: string[]): void {
    magicians1.forEach(magician1 =>
        console.log(magician1));
}

function make_great(magicians1: string[]): void{
    for (let i = 0; i < magicians1.length; i++) {
        magicians1[1] = "the Great " + magicians1[1];
    }
}

show_magicians(magicians1);

// Call make_great() to modify the array of magicians
make_great(magicians1);

// Call show magicians() to see that the list has been modified
show_magicians(magicians1);
